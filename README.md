# ✂️ Rock Paper Scissors – The Odin Project  

A simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. This project focuses on fundamental JavaScript concepts like functions, conditionals, and event handling.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Play against the computer in a best-of-five match  
- Interactive UI with real-time feedback  
- Built using **JavaScript**  
- Since the assignment states that only **JavaScript** should be used, I did not include any unnecessary styling or HTML elements beyond what was required.
